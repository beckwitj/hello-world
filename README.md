## About James
A long, long time ago, well before a well-known computer pioneer opined that nobody would need a computer in their home, I read about "thinking machines". I learned that they were very big, consumed a great amount of electricity, and that they were few in number. Isac Asimov's *robot* stories offered a different perspective, including the need for **robot psychologists**. I knew that was what I wanted to become.
